# Email Spam Classifier

Welcome to the repo for my spam/ham classifier! This project was an implementation of using basic NLP packages in python to filter stopwords, remove punctuation, and clean up the email text input data. 

Using TFIDF Vectorizer, Logisitic Regression Models, and SGDClassifier Models I was able to achieve up to 0.996 for validation F1 score. 

Please feel free to run through the code!
